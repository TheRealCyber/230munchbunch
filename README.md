## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a balanced diet poses significant challenges, especially for individuals with chronic illnesses and the elderly. These groups face unique obstacles in navigating nutrition and health management. For those with chronic conditions, understanding and adhering to specific dietary requirements is crucial. Understanding complex food labels, tracking nutritional intake, and managing restrictions can be overwhelming. Elderly individuals may struggle with additional problems such as reduced mobility or cognitive decline. The lack of accessible, personalized nutrition guidance hinders their ability to achieve their health goals. Many find themselves lost in conflicting information, unsure how to adapt dietary advice to their specific needs. Moreover, the goal of sustainable and healthier eating adds another layer of complexity. A critical factor is the lack of community support and resources specifically designed for these groups. Many feel isolated in their dietary struggles, without access to peer support or expert guidance. Additionally, elderly individuals often struggle with technology, finding complex websites challenging to navigate.
